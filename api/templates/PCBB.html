        <h1 class="title">Producer & Consumer Problem with Bounded Buffer & Monitor</h1>
        <p class="information">
            A producer process produces information that is consumed by a consumer process. <br><br>

            The producer-consumer problem is a classic issue in computer science that involves two types of processes:
            producers and consumers, which share a common buffer.
            <br> The problem arises when producers
            generate items and place them into the buffer, while consumers retrieve and process these items from the
            buffer.
            <br>
            <br>

            The challenge is to ensure that:
            <br>
            - Producers don't put items into the buffer if it's full.
            <br>
            - Consumers don't try to take items from an empty buffer.
            <br><br>

            In a Producer Consumer Problem, Two types of buffers can be used:<br><br>
            The <u>Unbounded Buffer</u> places no practical
            limit on the size of the buffer. The consumer may have to wait for new items,
            but the producer can always produce new items.
            <br><br>
            The <u>Bounded Buffer</u> assumes
            a fixed buffer size. In this case, the consumer must wait if the buffer is empty,
            and the producer must wait if the buffer is full.

            <br><br>
            In the semaphore solution to the critical-section problem. Each process must execute wait (mutex) before
            entering the critical section and signal (mutex) after exiting the critical section.
            <br>
            The sequence in which the wait and signal methods of a semaphore is executed must be perfect or else it
            will lead to synchronization issues such as deadlock.
        </p>
        <h2>Monitors</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="information">
            So what is a Monitor? It is a high level synchronization construct that contains different operations and
            declaration of shared variables that provide mutual exclusion. <br>

            The Producer and Consumer can only itneract with the Monitors methods and the methods will then work with
            shared variables.
