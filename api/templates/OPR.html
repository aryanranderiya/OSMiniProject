        <h1>Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm</h1>

        <div class="info">
            <p>
                Optimal Page Replacement is an algorithm used to manage memory in a computer system, particularly in the
                context
                of virtual memory management. Its goal is to minimize the number of page faults, which occur when a
                requested
                page is not found in the main memory (RAM) and must be retrieved from secondary storage (e.g., disk).
            </p>
            <p>
                The algorithm works by predicting the future page accesses and replacing the page in memory that will
                not be
                accessed for the longest time. To accomplish this, it requires knowledge of the future page accesses,
                which is
                usually not available in real-world systems. As a result, the Optimal Page Replacement algorithm is used
                as a
                theoretical reference to measure the performance of other page replacement algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite its theoretical nature, understanding the Optimal Page Replacement algorithm can provide
                insights into
                the importance of optimal memory management and the trade-offs involved in designing efficient page
                replacement strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                One challenge with the Optimal Page Replacement algorithm is its impracticality in real-world scenarios
                due to
                the need for future page access information. However, it serves as a benchmark for evaluating the
                performance
                of other page replacement algorithms, such as LRU (Least Recently Used) and FIFO (First-In-First-Out).
