            <h2>Introduction to Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN) Algorithm</h2>
            <p>
                Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN), also known as Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) or Preemptive
                SJF (Shortest Job First), is a CPU scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the smallest
                remaining burst time to execute next. This algorithm ensures that shorter jobs are given priority
                over longer ones, leading to reduced average waiting time and turnaround time.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Preemptive: The currently running process can be preempted if a new process with a shorter burst
                    time arrives.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Priority: The priority of processes changes dynamically based on their remaining burst
                    time.</li>
                <li>Optimality: SRTN is optimal among all preemptive scheduling algorithms because it minimizes the
                    average waiting time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Operation:</h3>
            <p>
                At each clock tick, the algorithm selects the process with the smallest remaining burst time to
                execute. If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the currently running process, the
                CPU is preempted, and the new process starts execution. The remaining burst time of the preempted
                process is saved, and it goes back to the ready queue. The algorithm continues until all processes
                are completed.
            </p>
            <h3>Implementation:</h3>
            <p>
                To implement SRTN, the scheduler maintains a ready queue of processes sorted by their remaining burst
                times. The CPU scheduler selects the process with the smallest remaining burst time from the ready
                queue for execution. If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the currently running
                process, a context switch occurs, and the new process starts execution.
            </p>
